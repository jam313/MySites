				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				
				<p>So, this summer is [<em>hopefully</em>] my final summer as an undergraduate student. I am taking classes during the second summer semester, so I have decided to use the first semester to learn more about various aspects of the computer science field. One of my main projects will be to contruct a slick website in which I can display my resum&eacute;, ongoing and finished projects, and possibly a link to a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repository or two that I feel I can be proud of. Hopefully, it will all come together and be an awesome asset to later show potential employers, potential clients, and friends and family.</p>

				<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
				
				<p>Well how rude of me for not introducing myself! My name is John Austin and I am a senior computer science - not computer engineering; yes there is a difference - student at a really cool university. I like short walks on the beach and stuffing my face with pie until I can no longer move... 
				<br/>Ok, the last couple things are not true. My mother will very likely pay close attention to the progress of this site (you know how mothers are) and I feel she would feel uncomfortable with me sharing "too much" information on the internet, which, to her credit, is probably a good idea. Lots of crazies out there.
				<br/> Just know that I'm a decently cool dude, with decently interesting interests. Thanks for reading this far if you have!</p>
