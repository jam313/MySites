			<p>Here I a will keep a list of the major changes made to the site and when they were made. Obviously, I will not log every single tiny change - no need for this page to go on forever. Some little changes will be noted if they feel like milestones to me but for the most part this will be a sort of development log, mostly for my records. <br/>
			The major break points will be when I develop the knowledge of a new skill or language; e.g. the addition of CSS and later when I add JavaScript and more fun things. You can also see previous versions of the site via a dropdown above. Again these a previous version will only be added after a major change to the site.</p>
			
			<p>**Note: I will also add "Back" and "Home" links to each new previous version and possibly also "Previous" and "Next" links;
