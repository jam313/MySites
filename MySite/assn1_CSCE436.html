        <p>Howdy, my name is John Austin Moreno and I am a senior computer science major from a little town called Gatesville, TX. I would be surprised if you have heard of it unless you have had family in the military or prison (Gatesville is right next to Fort Hood, and has a VERY large prison system. In my limited down time I enjoy being outside; running, rock climbing, mountain biking, paddling are all passions of mine along with playing with my dog who is the most beautiful girl in the entire world. By the way, the kids in that picture are my cousins.</p>
		
		<p>To be honest, my reasons for taking 436 were pretty shallow – at first. I, like many, just needed to fill my required CSCE Information track credit and I knew Professor Moore was a really cool guy (and I am not just schmoozing. Seriously. Talk to him. Super cool). That being said, after reading a bit from the recommended text, Design of Everyday Things, I have realized just how much this class could affect not only my work in the field of computer science but everything else. I can list off so many designs that are so unintuitive that they make a job harder that they are designed to make easier. </p>
		
		<p>I’ve obviously taken all the required CSCE courses that most of the people in this class have had to take but now I have started on my focus in the Systems track and have completed. CSCE 410, Operating Systems; CSCE 465, Computer and Network Security. I am currently enrolled in CSCE 462, Microcomputer Systems; CSCE 463, Networks and Distributed Processing; and CSCE 431, Sofware Engineering. I have also taken CSCE 411, Design and Analysis of Algorithms; and CSCE 481, Senior Seminar. Only a few more credits to go before graduation (WHOOP) but for now I am work at a software company located in Bryan, FrogSlayer, LLC, as a developer. </p>
